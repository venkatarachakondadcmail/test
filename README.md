# Program to Print All Duplicates in a String and Their Counts

This program is designed to identify and print all the duplicate characters in a given string, along with their respective counts.

## Description

The program takes a string as input and iterates through each character. It maintains a dictionary to store the frequency count of each character encountered. Once the iteration is complete, the program identifies the characters with a count greater than 1, indicating duplicates. It then prints the duplicate characters and their corresponding counts in the desired format.

## Example

Consider the following input:

```python
input_string = "hello"
